## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-25

**First production-ready release! 🎉**

This release brings SyncKit from concept to production-ready sync engine with comprehensive testing, documentation, and real-world examples.

### Added

#### Core Engine
- **LWW Sync Algorithm** - Last-Write-Wins merge with field-level granularity
- **Text CRDT** - YATA-based collaborative text editing (in Rust core)
- **Custom CRDTs** - PN-Counter and OR-Set implementations (in Rust core)
- **Binary Protocol** - Protobuf-based efficient wire format with compression
- **Vector Clocks** - Causality tracking for distributed operations
- **Delta Computation** - Efficient delta-based synchronization
- **WASM Compilation** - Optimized WASM bundles (48.9KB default, 43.8KB lite variant gzipped)
- **Formal Verification** - TLA+ proofs for LWW, vector clocks, convergence (118,711 states verified)

#### TypeScript SDK
- **Document API** - Simple object sync with `sync.document<T>()`
- **Storage Adapters** - IndexedDB (default), Memory, and abstract adapter interface
- **Network Sync** - WebSocket client with auto-reconnect and exponential backoff
- **Offline Queue** - Persistent operation queue with retry logic (47,000 ops/sec)
- **Network Monitoring** - Connection state, queue status, and sync state tracking
- **React Integration** - `useSyncDocument`, `useSyncField`, `useSyncDocumentList`, `useNetworkStatus`, `useSyncState`, `useSyncKit` hooks
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety with generics and strict mode
- **Two Optimized Variants** - Default (~58KB total) and Lite (~45KB total) gzipped

**Note:** v0.1.0 includes full network sync capabilities with WebSocket server, offline queue, and auto-reconnection. Text CRDT and custom CRDTs (Counter, Set) are available in the Rust core but not yet exposed in the TypeScript SDK - coming in future releases.

- **Auto-Reconnection** - Exponential backoff (1s → 30s max, 1.5x multiplier)
- **Heartbeat/Ping-Pong** - Keep-alive mechanism (30s interval, 5s timeout)
- **Message Queue** - 1000 operation capacity with overflow handling
- **State Management** - Connection state tracking (disconnected/connecting/connected/reconnecting/failed)
- **Authentication Support** - Token provider integration for secure connections

- **Bundle Size:** 58.3KB gzipped total (9.4KB JS + 48.9KB WASM, default variant), 45.3KB gzipped total (1.5KB JS + 43.8KB WASM, lite variant)
- **Memory Usage:** ~3MB for 10K documents
- **Queue Throughput:** 47,000 operations/sec (offline queue with persistence)

- **Test Suite:** 91% coverage across unit, integration, network, and chaos tests
- **Code Quality:** Full TypeScript strict mode, Rust clippy clean, no warnings

## Upgrade Guide

### From Pre-Release to v0.1.0

If you were using SyncKit during development (Phases 1-9):

```typescript
// No breaking changes! API is stable
import { SyncKit } from '@synckit/sdk'

const sync = new SyncKit({
  storage: 'indexeddb',
  name: 'my-app',
  serverUrl: 'ws://localhost:8080'  // Optional - enables network sync
})

await sync.init()

const doc = sync.document<Todo>('todo-1')
await doc.init()
await doc.update({ completed: true })

// Monitor network status
const status = sync.getNetworkStatus()
console.log(status?.queueSize)

// Use React hooks
import { useSyncDocument, useNetworkStatus } from '@synckit/sdk'

function MyComponent() {
  const [todo, { update }] = useSyncDocument<Todo>('todo-1')
  const networkStatus = useNetworkStatus()

  return <div>{todo.text}</div>
}
```

### Future Upgrades

Migration guides will be provided for all breaking changes in future versions.
